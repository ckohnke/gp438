Exploratory seismic data analysis in the field

Interactive display of survey geometry
---
get station (flag) locations
  from handheld GPS
  convert to UTM coordinates, if necessary
  store in spreadsheet or tab-delimited text
    station# stationXYZ

compute source and receiver locations
  for each valid shot FFID (unique field record identifier)
    use observer notes/files to determine 
      source station number (and offset/skid, if any)
      which recording channels are live
      mapping from live channel numbers to receiver station numbers
    use station locations to lookup UTM coordinates (x,y)
      for both source and receivers
    use USGS digital elevation maps to lookup elevations (z) 
    store in spreadsheet or tab text
       FFID SEGDfileName source station# channel# sourceXYZ receiverXYZ
  note that FFID increase sequentially
    but some FFIDs correspond to bad shots and must be ignored

displays source-receiver coordinates
  plot source/receiver/midpoint (x,y) in map view
  interactively specify a piecewise linear curve through these points
    begin by specifying just one line segment
    this curve defines the seismic "line"
  plot elevation profile source/receiver/midpoint z vs distance along curve
    project source/receiver/midpoint (x,y) onto curve
  use slider to select and show points for each FFID
    as we move the slider, the points (x,y) or z move along the line
    provides a graphical history of the seismic survey
    will help us catch mistakes

Interactive display of seismograms
---
convert seismograms in SEGD files to IEEE (float) files
  I have some Python code that does this
  should be translated to Java

display by FFID
  as we move the FFID slider
    display all seismograms for that FFID
      sorted by channel number
      sorted by signed receiver-source distance

display by midpoints within a circle
  as we move/resize the circle in map view of midpoints (x,y)
    display all seismograms for which midpoints lie within the circle
      sorted by signed receiver-source distance

display by offsets (signed receiver-source distances)
  as we move/resize a min-max slider for a range of offsets
    display all seismograms for which offset is within that range
      sorted by distance of midpoint along the line

a few interactive controls for 
  gain
  amplitude balancing
  zoom and scroll (already provided by edu.mines.jtk.mosaic)
